<p>Hi. My name is Srikanth and I have recently graduated with Masters in Computer Science at Indiana University, Bloomington. I also have a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering and over 5 years of experience in Software where I worked on several development and support projects.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to a computer in my 2nd grade where I learnt Logo which was also the first program I ever wrote. It was the generation of 5 1/4 inch floppy drives. I was first introduced to Internet in my 12th grade and the first website I opened was Yahoo. My undergraduate degree gave me a good understanding of a computer and showed me the joy in programming which I relished for over 5 years. There was always a constant need to me learn new thing which pushed me to know about the latest technology at work. I wanted to know about the other areas of knowledge and chose to pursue Masters to increase my area of knowledge.</p>
<p>I am very interested in the study of Compilers, Operating Systems, Programming Languages since they are primary abstractions which enable any programmer to innovate without having to deal with the details of implementation and thereby implementing their idea very easily. I am also intrigued with Artificial Intelligence and gamut of solutions it can offer.</p>
<p>I am actively looking for full time opportunities as a Software Engineer.<br/>My ideal company would have the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Delivers a exciting end product.</li>
		<li>Has an amicable and cooperative Team.</li>
		<li>Provied opportunities to learn.</li>
	</ul>	
</p>
