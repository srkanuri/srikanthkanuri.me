<p>I am a Graduate Student (Masters) in Computer Science at Indiana University, Bloomington. I am in my final semester and am currently seeking Full Time positions in Software. I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering and also have over 5 years of experience in Software where I worked on several development and support projects. </p>
<p>I am comfortable with Java, Python, SQL, Scheme, Haskell, C, C++, PHP, BPEL, etc. I am very interested in the study of Compilers, Operating Systems, Programming Languages since they are primary abstractions which enable any programmer to innovate without having to deal with the details of implementation and thereby implementing their train of thought.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to a career in Software where I can continue learning for the rest of my life and also utilize my skills to make contributions or create tools and applications which will provide abstractions to users and enable them to be more productive.</p>
